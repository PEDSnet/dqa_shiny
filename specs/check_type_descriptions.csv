Check Type,Check Description
Data Cycle Changes (DC),"Outputs differences between previous and current data cycles. This involves both total row counts as well as total patient counts. It can also include changes across domains: For example, outpatient labs, which combined both the visit and measurement domains, can be computed with this check. Cohort-specific counts can also be computed with this check, if requested to the DCC."
Valueset Conformance,"Checks whether there are any valueset violations in the submission. Valueset violations are values that are outside of an accepted range of permissible values, usually defined in the PEDSnet conventions. For example, visit types in the PEDSnet data model can only contain a series of values that are specified in the conventions document."
Conformance,"Checks whether values for a particular field violate the expected vocabulary. An example of a vocabulary violation is if an RxNorm code was found in the Immunizations table, which can only take on values in the CVX vocabulary."
Unmapped Concepts,"Computes the proportion of unmapped concepts for a given domain. For example, this check type may be applied to the drug_exposure table to determine the proportion of unmapped prescriptions. The output of this check type contains three parts: First, the raw proportion of unmapped concepts; Second, unmapped concepts over time, both for complete windows as well as truncated to 2009 to current calendar year; Third, the unmapped source values are also shown to assist ETL analysts in viewing what the top unmapped values are for each domain."
Clinical Fact Documentation,"Computes the proportion of visits with missing fact types. For example, one of the applications of this could be to check the proportion of inpatient visits without an associated condition. This check type can also compute combination of facts such as inpatient visits without an association condition OR medication administration."
Best Mapped Concepts,"Computes the proportion of concepts mapped to an ideal set of values. The output shows the proportion of concepts mapped to each level of a hierarchy (e.g. RxNorm for drugs) or categories of a categorical variable. For some of the check implementations, best concepts are determined through a defined set of values while in others, best concepts are any that are not in a defined set of not-best values."
Facts Over Time,"Computes different clinical facts over a range of time (starting from 2009 to the most recent data submission. We have normalized the graph using the following heuristic: (current month)/((month-1)*.25+(month+1)*.25+(month-12)*.5). In plain words, it is the current month divided by the weighted average of the previous month, the next month, and the value from the current month in the previous year. In this check, we have a summary graph that plots each site's normalized value as a distance from the aggregate value of all sites' normalized value. The graphs below display each site's normalized value in comparison to all site values."
Domain Concordance,Computes the overlap of patients across more than one domain or clinical characteristic both by year and overall. The combined count in the output is the number of patients meeting both cohort definitions. Proportions are calculated where the numerator is the number of patients meeting the given cohort definition and the denominator is the total number of patients meeting one or both definitions (i.e. patients in cohort 1 + patients in cohort 2 - patients in both cohort 1 and cohort 2).
Facts with Associated Visit ID,Computes the proportion of records in each of the domains that do not have an associated visit_occurrence_id
Expected Concepts Present,"Computes the proportion of patients with evidence of a specified concept, out of a check-specific denominator. For checks regarding location, the denominator is all patients with a valid date of birth + sex + at least 1 diagnosis code for a face-to-face encounter. For all other (non-location) checks, the denominator is all patients with at least one drug + procedure + lab."
